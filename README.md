# reverse-wikipedia-backend
All of the backend code for my Reverse Wikipedia project.

The main.py file adds the image hashes to the database. It assumes you have already downloaded the [wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05.zim](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/kiwix/zim/wikipedia/) file from Kiwix. It also assumes that you have set up PostgreSQL as described in [my tutorial accompanying this project](https://github.com/KDJDEV/imagehash-reverse-image-search-tutorial).

The web server is inside the /server directory.
